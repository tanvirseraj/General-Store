## Overview

### What is Appium? 

Appium is an open source test automation framework for use with native, hybrid and mobile web apps. 
It drives iOS, Android, and Windows apps using the WebDriver protocol. Appium is built on the idea that testing native apps shouldn't require including an SDK or recompiling your app. And that you should be able to use your preferred test practices, frameworks, and tools. Appium also has made design and tool decisions to encourage a vibrant contributing community.

### Why Appium? 

As a test developer it is quite hard to create a good automated test suite that works on the iOS and Android platforms. Both Android and iOS have a couple of different test frameworks that work well but have nothing to do with each other. So you then have to create and maintain two separate test suites, one for Android and one for iOS. They are also written in different languages and with different development tools (IDEs) so even if the applications work the same it is hard to share any code between the tests for the different platforms.
But this is where Appium comes in. From Appium's own website:
